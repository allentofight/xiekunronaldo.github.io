<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text">Ext.util.DelayedTask objects wrap a function to be called at some point in the future. These objects also expose the cancel() method, giving more control to the developer, as the task not only can be passed as parameter to other parts of the application, but it can also be canceled if needed. On the other hand, the Ext.Function.defer() provides a non-cancelable, one-shot execution of a function.
